## INTRO
### BrainFuck
Brainfuck is a Turing-complete programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, and notable for its extreme minimalism. This language consists of eight commands, listed below.

<table>
	<tr><th>command</th><th>meaning</th></tr>
	<tr><td>></td>
		<td>increment the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the right).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td><</td>
		<td>decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>+</td>
		<td>increment (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>-</td>
		<td>decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the data pointer.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>.</td>
		<td>output the byte at the data pointer.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>,</td>
		<td>accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer.</td>
	<tr><td>[</td>
		<td>if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ] command.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>]</td>
		<td>if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching [ command.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### This Interpreter
This interpreter was made as a product for my beginning level study of programming language, hence, it is simple and crude, use an array of 3,000 byte cells and at most accept 10,000 bytes of characters input. It just test by a limited test set which in the directory *test*. 
####Install
Download this project and there are executable programs for windows7 64bit and linux, if can't run it correctly or you wnat to compile it manually, following steps below:
	
	git clone https://github.com/touchEngine/brainfuck.git
	cd brainfuck/src
	make
	make install
	make clean
And all will be done if no error messsage.
#### Useage
	type 'brainfuck' in your teminal with no argument to start an interactive prompt or
	brainfuck [option] [arg]
	options:
	-f <file>	input the file and run it
	-h 			show the help information
	-r <code>	run the brainfuck code directly
	-v 			show version information of this interpreter
